modversion=1.0.0

description=This mod was inspired in Kechna's wood weight mods. I just merged the idea of each mod and added (in sandbox mode) a selector to define reduce percentage, with the default set to 75%. Additionally, I extended the reduction feature to spears where the base spear has the same weight as the Tree Branch.
