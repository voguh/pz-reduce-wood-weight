title=[B41] Reduce Wood Weight
description=This mod was inspired in [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2671262464]Kechna's 75% Wood Weight[/url].

description=I just merged the idea of each mod and added (in sandbox mode) a reduction selector, with the default set to 50%.
description=Additionally, I extended the reduction feature to spears where the base spear has the same weight as the Tree Branch.
