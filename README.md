# Reduce Wood Weight

This mod was inspired in [Kechna's 75% Wood Weight](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2671262464).

I just merged the idea of each mod and added (in sandbox mode) a reduction selector, with the default set to 50%.
Additionally, I extended the reduction feature to spears where the base spear has the same weight as the Tree Branch.
